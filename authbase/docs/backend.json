    "reasoning": "This design prioritizes user profile management with a structure that supports secure authentication and profile data storage. It leverages path-based ownership for user profiles, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access and modify their own profile data. This structure is highly secure and makes ownership-based security rules simple and efficient, which satisfies the 'User Authentication' and 'Profile Management' core app features. The database-centric approach aligns with 'Session Handling'.\n\nAuthorization Independence: Path-based ownership inherently provides authorization independence since access control is determined by the path itself (`/users/{userId}/profile`) and the authenticated user ID. No `get()` calls are needed to determine ownership.\n\nQAPs: The structure enables secure list operations (QAPs) because profiles are stored in a dedicated path per user (`/users/{userId}/profile`), preventing unauthorized access to other user's profiles. List operation would be done under a `userId` which is tied to a user's authentication token, further securing data access."
